## Tau
### R2/Tau
These simulations were generated by the Shae group and published in the following publication (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.141815511)

GROMACS 4.6.1

Force Field: OPLS

Solvent: Three-site transferrable intermolecular potential rigid water - Neutralized with NaCl

NPT ensemble @ 300K & 1 bar of isotropic barostat for equilibrium box dimensions at a compressibility of 4.5 x 10^-5bar^-1

NVT ensemble using Nose-Hoover thermostat 

Peptide bonds were constrained with the LINCS algorithm & Water was constrained with SETTLE

The models used for TMAO (2M) and Urea (5M) were previously developed by Weerashinghe and Smith (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1622372), and Larini and Shea (https://doi.org/10.1021/jp403635g) 

### R4-R'/Tau

Modelled from a tau-microtubule ensemble (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7PQC)

GROMACS 2022

Force Field: AMBER99SB-ILDN

Solvent: TIP3P water - Neutralized with NaCl
# BOX SIZE, No. atoms, water, cofactors
Minimized: steepest descent algorithm 50,000 steps w/ Verlet cutoff scheme
# TEMPERATURE SETTING?
NVT: leapfrog integrator, verlet cutoff scheme & velocity-rescaling thermostat for 500ps
# ISOTROPIC?
NPT: leapfrog integrator, verlet cutoff scheme & velocity-rescaling thermostat for 500ps with Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling

Coulombic interactions were treated with with PME algorithm while non-bonded interactions used the Verlet cutoff scheme

*SEED NUMBERS*:
# COBYS SEEDS

### Katanin (Monomer & Trimer

The Monomer was modelled from chain A of the spiral conformation of the hexamer(https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6UGD)

The Trimer was modelled from chains A, B & C of the ring conformation of the hexamer(https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6UGE)

GROMACS 2019

Force Field: GROMOS96 54a7

The force field for ATP was generated from the automated topology builder server based on the GROMOS96 54a7 force field

Solvent: single point charge (SPC) explicit solvent - Neutralized with NaCl

# BOX SIZE

This resulted in a box size of XXX with 327052 total atoms (105790 water molecules).

Minimized: steepest descent algorithm 50,000 steps w/ Verlet cutoff scheme (with a criteria of the maximum force value smaller than 23.9006 kcal/mol/A to remove steric clashes

NVT: leapfrog integrator, verlet cutoff scheme & velocity-rescaling thermostat for 500ps to 300K

# ISOTROPIC?
NPT: leapfrog integrator, verlet cutoff scheme & velocity-rescaling thermostat for 500ps with Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling to 1 bar

Bond lengths with hydrogen atoms were constrained with the LINCS algorithm to use a 2fs integration  step

Coulombic interactions were treated with with PME algorithm while non-bonded interactions used the Verlet cutoff scheme (10.0 A)
