# System Naming Key

## R2/Tau Systems
Simulations provided by Joan-Emma Shae

## R4-R'/Tau System
Structure generated with Modeller plug-in from the ChimeraX on the tau-bound microtubule ensemble from rcsb (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7PQC)

The tubulin included in the original PDB were excluded from these simulations.

## Katanin Systems

### Monomer 
Modelled from chain A of the spiral conformation of the available hexamer from rcsb (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6UGD)

6UGD-A

The cofactor states are indicated by the presend cofactors:

COMPLEX: ATP + Substrate (E14) - as seen in the solved structure

NUC: ATP only

SUB: Substrate (E14) only

APO: No cofactors

### Trimer
Modelled from chains A, B, & C of the ring conformation of the available hexamer from rcsb (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6UGE)

6UGE-ABC

These systems were only simulated in the COMPLEX and APO cofactor setups.
