# System Naming Key

## R2/Tau Systems
Simulations provided by Joan-Emma Shae (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1418155112 & https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2016.11.006) 

## R4-R'/Tau Systems
S 

## Katanin Monomer Systems
Modelled from chain A of the spiral conformation of the available hexamer from rcsb (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6UGD)

6UGD-A

The cofactor states are indicated by the presend cofactors:

COMPLEX: ATP + Substrate (E14)

NUC: ATP only

SUB: Substrate (E14) only

APO: No cofactors

## Katanin Trimer Systems
Modelled from chains A, B, & C of the ring conformation of the available hexamer from rcsb (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6UGE)

6UGE-ABC

These systems were only simulated in the COMPLEX and APO cofactor setups.
